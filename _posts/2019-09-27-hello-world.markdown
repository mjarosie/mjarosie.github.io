For quite a while I've been thinking about setting up a website on which I'd be able to share my notes on all the technical things (but not only!) that I've learnt or somehow figured out. Finally - here it is!

As this is the first blog post that I've ever written, let me introduce myself. I'm Maciej (or less formally Maciek), a Polish expat currently living in London, the UK. I'm a software developer by profession and I love everything about computer science. I'm also interested in applications of machine learning to practical problems, as well as delving into the theoretical aspects of all the bits and pieces involved.

Apart from that I've got a constantly fluctuating set of hobbies which involve playing music (now getting my head around harmonica and ukulele), travelling and reading books.

Welcome to my blog!
