Hi! I'm Maciej (or less formally Maciek), a Polish expat currently living in London, the UK. I'm a software developer by profession and I love everything about computer science. I'm also interested in applications of machine learning to practical problems, as well as delving into the theoretical aspects of all the bits and pieces involved.

Apart from that I've got a constantly fluctuating set of hobbies which involve playing music (now getting my head around harmonica and ukulele), travelling and reading books.
